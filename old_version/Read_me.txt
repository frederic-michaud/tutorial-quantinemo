The quantiNEMO tutorial package

Based on quantiNEMO2 version 0.9.0 (14.08.2014)
and with the aid of FSTAT version 2.9.4

The three word-files contain the three chapters: Demography, Neutral genetics, Selection.
Tutorial 1 is preceded by a chapter 0, that explains how to use this tutorial and quantiNEMO, including a separate section per operating system. However, the sections on Mac and Unix are still missing, since I have no experience in using them on these platforms.

SETUP_FILES contains the scripts for each section, plus any additional files (such as allelic-effects files etc.).
R_SCRIPTS contains the r-scripts used to produce the graphs for each tutorial. 
RESULTS contains the results you get when running each script.

I think the best format for these tutorials would be an html webpage with links to the setup files and r-scripts, and perhaps even links to the relevant sections in the manual. Also, currently, copy-pasting sample code from the word-file into an ini-file does not work.
